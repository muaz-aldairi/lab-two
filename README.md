In this class I have learned about JavaScript operaters which are (Arithmetic Operator, Assignment Operator, Comparison Operator, Logical Operator).

In arithmetic Operator we learend how to do the following operations (+ - * / ** % ). Also we learned about increment operator (++) which increments the value of the variable by one and could be Pre-Increment: increments the value, and then assigns the expression or post-Increment: print the value and then increment and assign a new value. Decrement operator(--) decrements the value of the variable by one and could be Pre-decrement or post-decrement.In addition we learned how to covert variables from one data type to another.
Assignment Operators such as (=,+=,-=,*=,%=,/=,) are used to assign the value of the variable.
Comparison Operators such as (==,===,!=,!==,<,>,<=,=>) are used to check the values of the variables and their data type. 

Learning these operators is cosidered as a crucial process for student to be able to use JavaScript for building a softwere, and for this reason every student has applied a practical example on his machine for each operation. For better understanding all these example should be repeated many times.
